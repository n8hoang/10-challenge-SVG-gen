## Description

This project uses object oriented programming and test oriented programming. It will allow you to generate an svg logo with your choice of 3 characters and choice of text ccolor, shape, and shape color. I would say that this project really helped me with getting used to using classes and exporting information from one js page to another using module.exports.
